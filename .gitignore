# Exclude these files from the git repo

# Note: the trailing /* is significant. If a directory is excluded, Git will never look
# at the contents of that directory. The pattern dir/ excludes a directory named dir
# and (implicitly) everything under it. The pattern dir/* says nothing about dir itself;
# it just excludes everything under dir. With dir/, Git will never look at anything under
# dir, and thus will never apply any of the “un-exclude” patterns to anything under dir.
# With dir/*, Git will process the direct contents of dir, giving other patterns a chance
# to un-exclude some bit of the content.
