Causes the excerpt to be required before a post can be published. Supports both editor types (classic and block). Filters are provided for customization; see the [User Guide](https://www.codenamemiked.com/plugins/mandatory-excerpt/) for complete usage tips.

== Description ==
An excerpt is a (usually) brief, text-only post summary. It is used in various places of a theme when a summary of a post is needed, such as on your blog page and archive pages for terms.

Excerpts are either manually crafted or (usually poorly) automatically extracted from the main post content. Hand crafted ones are better because

* they avoid things like sentences being cut off in the mid…
* they allow you create an actual summary and not just the first x words from the post content
* they allow you to do better SEO targeting
* they look better

This plugin will enforce the use of hand-crafted excerpts by your users by preventing a post without an excerpt from being published.

Tip: If you don’t see a spot for the excerpt in your post edit screen, there are two possible reasons for this.

1. The post type does not support the excerpt field. Generally, posts and pages support it but it can be turned off in code.
2. The Excerpt field is not being displayed. To see it, click on Screen Options button on the top right corner of the classic editor post edit screen and then enable it.

Classic editor support is based on the work done by Scott Walkinshaw and other contributors, found [here](https://gist.github.com/swalkinshaw/2695510)

There isn't one.

= Does this plugin support custom post types? =
Yes, if the custom post type supports the excerpt field. But you'll have to specifically include it using the `mandatory_excerpt_post_types` filter. See [here](https://www.codenamemiked.com/plugins/mandatory-excerpt/filters/).

== Screenshots ==

1. Classic Editor: If you try to save a post without an excerpt, this message will appear and the post status will be reset to "draft."
2. Classic Editor: If you don't see the Excerpt section, it may be because it's not enabled. Click Screen Options at the top right of the edit screen, and enable it.
3. Gutenberg/Block Editor: the Publish/Update button is disabled until the excerpt has content. You also get a message about the missing excerpt.
